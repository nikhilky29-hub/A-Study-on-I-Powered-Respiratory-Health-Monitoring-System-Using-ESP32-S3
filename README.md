# A-Study-on-I-Powered-Respiratory-Health-Monitoring-System-Using-ESP32-S3
This project presents a low-cost, AI-powered respiratory health monitoring system built on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller. It uses TinyML to analyse breathing sounds locally and classify respiratory conditions in real time, ensuring low latency and strong privacy. Optional ThingSpeak integration enables remote visualisation
